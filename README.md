A new Flutter project.
# QuizzApp
ðŸ“± Quizzes are often used for knowledge assessment: 
Users can assess their knowledge by answering quiz questions. 
Interactive Learning: Quizzes engage users and encourage active learning.

ðŸš€ So i have developed the Flutter quiz app I crafted an engaging quiz app using Flutter. ðŸ“±

In this Flutter Quiz App, Iâ€™ve crafted an engaging experience for users to test their knowledge on various topics. The app features multiple-choice questions, correct and wrong answer detection, and insightful remarks.

ðŸ¤– Model Classes: Iâ€™ve organized our data using model classes. Each question is represented by a Question model, containing the question text and answer options.

ðŸ¤– I have maintain the appâ€™s state using setState. When users select an answer, the score updates dynamically. The app re-renders the UI based on the updated state, ensuring a smooth user experience.

ðŸ¤– Widget Tree :Our widget tree consists of several components:
Home Screen: Displays questions and answer buttons.
Result Screen: Shows the final score and a personalized remark.
Widgets like Column, Row, and ElevatedButton are used to create the UI.

[Please note that I have manually created the question list; it is not sourced from any external API. ]
